# Godot3_Netwoking_Demo
A simple networking demo using Godot 3.2.2, contains P2P and Client/Server functionality using high-level API.

This project is made up of 2 Godot projects, a P2P client and a dedicated server. The P2P client can host and join games, the dedicated server can only host.
I created this project while making a 2D platformer and wanted to understand how the Multiplayer networking work in Godot. It is a simple example that works on LAN, hopefully it may help others who want to do something similar. 

Code reviews and corrections are welcome.
